# LLM_Project
This is AI powered PDF summarizer using langchain, Huggingface, pypdf and streamlit ðŸš€. 

# What happens behind the scenes

ðŸ“ŒThe project uses PyPDF to read the content of PDF files and LangChainâ€™s CharacterTextSplitter to break the text into manageable chunks for processing. These chunks are then converted into semantic embeddings using Hugging Faceâ€™s sentence-transformers, and stored in FAISS, which allows for fast and accurate similarity searches.

âœ¨When you ask a question, the system retrieves the most relevant sections from the PDF and generates a concise answer using Hugging Faceâ€™s distilBART summarization model. This ensures that responses are not only relevant but also well-structured and easy to understand.

ðŸ“ŠThe interface is built with Streamlit, featuring a sleek, user-friendly design, animated chat bubbles, progress bars during PDF processing, and suggested sample questions to help users get started
